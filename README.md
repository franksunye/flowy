# Archive: Over-Engineered Refactor Attempt

⚠️ **This branch contains an over-engineered refactor attempt that was abandoned.**

## What happened here?

This branch represents a well-intentioned but ultimately misguided attempt to "modernize" the original Flowy library.

The refactor attempted to:

- Break down a simple 478-line file into multiple modules
- Add complex abstractions like BlockManager, DragStateManager, SnapEngine
- Implement a four-layer architecture for a simple drag-and-drop library
- Add extensive testing infrastructure and documentation

## The problems

1. **Complexity explosion**: From 478 lines to 1400+ lines
2. **Over-abstraction**: Added unnecessary layers that made the code harder to understand
3. **Introduced bugs**: The refactored version had functionality issues
4. **Maintenance burden**: Made the codebase much harder to maintain

## Lessons learned

1. **Simple solutions are often the best solutions**
2. **"Modern" doesn't always mean "better"**
3. **Refactoring needs clear business value, not just technical goals**
4. **The original 478-line version was actually well-designed**

## What's in this branch

- `src/` - The over-engineered modular version
- `docs/` - Extensive documentation for the complex architecture
- `tests/` - 151 test cases (many failing)
- Various configuration files for the "modern" toolchain

## Why we abandoned this

After analysis, we realized that:
- The original version worked perfectly
- The complexity added no real value
- Users care about functionality, not architecture
- Maintenance costs increased dramatically

## Going forward

We've returned to the original simple design in the master branch. This branch serves as a reminder that sometimes the best refactor is no refactor at all.
