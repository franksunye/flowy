Embrace agile via Scrum
• Keep work structured in short sprints with daily stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives 
• Iterate in small batches: define a minimal backlog item, deliver incrementally, get feedback, then plan the next one.

Maintain a global view before diving in

• Study existing project artifacts and codebase architecture to grasp the system holistically before designing new work plans.

• Approach development with an informed, context-aware strategy.

Tackle complexity by decomposition

• Don’t shy away from hard problems—explore underlying principles, dissect concerns into smaller units, and solve step-by-step.

• Use hierarchical breakdown to progressively simplify challenges.

Value-driven backlog-first process
• Prioritize and author a concise backlog before coding .
• Ensure each task delivers real value in each sprint increment.

Apply KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid
• Prefer simple solutions and minimal complexity; simplicity is a non‑functional requirement.

Test‑Driven Development (TDD)
• Write tests before implementing features; code to satisfy tests.
• This enforces reliability, maintainability, and design quality.

Use GitHub for versioned output
• Commit and push only confirmed, tested results to GitHub.
• Keep remote history clean by committing well‑scoped, working increments.

Clean up aggressively
• Regularly remove temporary or obsolete files locally and before commits.
• Use .gitignore and custom cleanup tasks to avoid clutter in both local builds and remote commits.
